### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on secret stuff
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how we accidentally expose internal stuff on Github
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a Oauth Client/App for Github users to list all their repositories
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about why ip allow lists are valuable in Zero Trust environments
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: Github is not enterprise ready
